Now, I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and statistical analysis. Leveraging 1+ year of experience in data-driven projects and a B.S. in Physics; excelling in transforming complex ideas into actionable strategies. Known for quick learning, effective mentorship, and fostering collaborative team environments. 

Alongside my physics experience, I thoroughly enjoyed teaching children, working first as a counselor and then as a science teacher for Nature's Classroom. I developed physics-based curriculums and improved my ability to communicate physics and experimental principles to a less knowledgeable audience, while exhibiting patience.

Though I used C++, Matlab, Excel, and Python in college, I have focused on Python for data science this year. I am comfortable using pandas for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing. I have conducted statistical analyses using namely T-tests, ANOVA, and bootstrapping. I've learned how to visualize data with Matplotlib and Pandas, though I often prefer Seaborn. I studied how to build web applications using Streamlit and utilized this for a work project with tech company DataSpeak. Much of my focus was on machine learning: understanding the inner mathematical workings, interpreting results and metrics, preprocessing data correctly for different models, implementing a variety of classification/regression models effectively, and communicating the results. I studied mostly supervised learning, and learned some unsupervised learning. I worked on projects specifically involving time series, neural networks and deep learning with Keras, and Natural Language Processing. I worked heavily with Large Language Models while developing a chatbot for DataSpeak. 

Most of my projects from 2023 on Github are essentially completed but could be expanded upon. I have ideas for my top projects and may work on these during my job search. These top projects include Telecom-Churn, Zyfra-Gold-Recovery, DataSpeak-QA, and OilyGiant-Region-Selection. I have a personal project involving rock climbing data that I have been playing with; I hope to use supervised learning techniques to predict the result of future route attempts based on past results. I will likely be working on some additional projects through my data science program, TripleTen, over the first half of 2024, so stay-tuned!</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JXIsHqn48Yf2_TWMFTmEUsxIixHTAPDhtiX0c2QOCd0/edit ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
